# Where is the European Sleeper?

Where is the European Sleeper? The European Sleeper being an open access train running in 4 countries makes this a difficult question to answer.

This project aims to answer that question with the use of open data. International trains have been noutourisly bad at sharing real time information when crossing borders. However the combination of several apps and national railway infrastructures usually provides the answer.

This project combines data gathered from NMBS/SNCB, NS, DB, ČD and European Sleeper themselves.


## Who is behind this?

This is a fan made project, not affiliated with European Sleeper Exploitatie B.V nor the European Sleeper Coöperatie U.A. nor any contractors hired by them.  
We just want to make open data be open and useful!

## What is out of scope?

- Keeping track of past perfomances and compositions
- Storing data in a database
- Track other trains than the ES452/453 (though feel free to copy our work)
- Implement any private data into the view

## Licencing

We value open source, we also value any uses based on our work to be contributed back into the open source community.
We therefore use the AGPL license.
